#+TITLE: TODO

** DONE Plot wave-forms
** DONE Plot missed / erroneous ticks in a useful manner
** DONE Plot long-term rate, beat error, amplitude with smoothed curve
** DONE Beat rate detect
** TODO Plot peaks
** TODO Control peak threshold / Better peak detection
** TODO Get rid of all errors in a clean environment (Needs better capture implementation)
*** WAIT Possibly: Improve capture by capturing longtime wave and then processing it
*** STRT Capture: Evaluate dt based on last two ticks to prevent following situation and make reset on MEM extremely seldom:
- Regular tick
- Tick detected t_1 too early, t_1 within tolerance
- Next tick detected t_2 too early, t_2 within tolerance, but t_1 + t_2 out of tolerance
*** STRT Is missing Audio frames due to incredibly slow matplotlib still an issue? Implement check
*** DONE Prevent missing frames due to slow plotting -> enable small frame sizes

** TODO Verify wave-form quality compared to tg-timer (ETA2782)
